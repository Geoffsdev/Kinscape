I helped of course, but immediately sensed I was not in as good shape as I was when we\'d go sailing with Pops and made a mental note to self to try to get to the gym more often.<br><br>The island was beautiful and thank goodness the sun broke through the fog there quite early today.

Once we got there, the views were spectacular. The pictures are in the next chapter.'
